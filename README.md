Predicting HDB Resale Prices/HDB Under Construction Prices

Our datasets are obtained from data.gov.sg but include additional columns processed before-hand.
Our ML Model was trained and uploaded as well.
This repository is simply to deploy a frontend application onto Streamlit for data visualisation as well as users to predict HDB Pricings.
